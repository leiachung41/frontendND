# Classic Arcade Game Clone

In this project I've built my own arcade game.

## How to play?
1. You can move like.
- up: press the keyboard ↑
- down: press the keyboard ↓
- right: press the keyboard →
- left: press the keyboard ←
2. If you collides with enemies a.k.a. bugs, you lost. And then, the game is reset.
3. If you reaches the water, the game is won.
