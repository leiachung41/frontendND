# Classic Arcade Game Clone

In this project I've built my own arcade game alike Frogger Game.

## Frogger Game Description
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies

## How to play?
1. You can move like.
- up: press the keyboard ↑
- down: press the keyboard ↓
- right: press the keyboard →
- left: press the keyboard ←
2. If you collides with enemies a.k.a. bugs, you lost. And then, the game is reset.
3. If you reaches the water, the game is won.
